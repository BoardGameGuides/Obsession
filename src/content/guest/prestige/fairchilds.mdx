In the lives of the landed gentry in Victorian Britain, advantageous marriages were a central theme. Marrying well was as desirable as marrying poorly was loathed, and love rarely had the power to break down such unromantic considerations. In Obsession, Charles and Elizabeth Fairchild represent the ultimate opportunity for families recovering from hard times to marry exceedingly well and form a highly advantageous connection.

Charles and Elizabeth come to Derbyshire from Yorkshire under tragic circumstances: the death of their parents on holiday. They arrive an unknown addition to Derbyshire society; the entire county is eager for any information about the Fairchild siblings.

Early news spreads: Charles is reserved and dignified, while Elizabeth, who shared her late mother’s love of society, has begun inviting prestigious Yorkshire guests of her acquaintance to visit.

The cards representing Charles and Elizabeth Fairchild are kept near the round track, where courtship events will be resolved. The winner of a courtship event takes one of the Fairchild cards into her [active hand](/term/active-hand) for use during the next season. Driven by romantic interest, Charles and Elizabeth Fairchild will attend any [event](/term/activity) regardless of the reputation of the hosting family. The Fairchild cards are managed like any other card once placed in hand after a successful courtship.

The favours granted by Charles and Elizabeth are not the same. Charles grants a favour of three reputation, while Elizabeth has favours of two reputation and an invitation to a prestige guest. Note that Charles enables the [admirer bonus](/term/admirer-bonus) for the young lady of any house, meaning that a visit from Charles can generate five reputation. Elizabeth, if attending an [activity](/term/activity) with the heir of any house, would generate two reputation, plus one from the heir for a total of three; she, however, also possesses a powerful prestige invitation favour.

At the conclusion of the first, second, and third seasons, the Fairchild card is returned to the round track area before the outcome of the next courtship. After the final courtship (fourth season), the Fairchild card chosen by the courtship winner (along with its significant 8 victory points) remains in the player’s hand for end game scoring.
