title: Admirer Bonus
---

A bonus favour of two reputation granted when a player’s eligible young female family member is sought out at a [social activity](activity) and made the object of conspicuous attention by a male prestige guest.

<div className="flavor-text">

A favourable marriage for a daughter from a family struggling with money, image, and social standing was a common obsession in Victorian Britain and in the literature of the 19th century. Few happenings excited a family’s optimism as much as the young lady of the house being paid court at a social event by an established, wealthy, and debonair single gentleman.

The card for each family’s eligible young lady references an Admirer Bonus. This bonus is only activated when the young lady’s card is played at the same [activity](activity) with a male prestige guest. The male prestige guest is identified by the presence of two fleurs-de-lis in the upper left-hand corner of the card and a reputation of three or more. When a male prestige guest is seen spending time with the young lady at an [activity](activity), the player receives two additional reputation during the “enjoy favours” stage of her turn.

Note that the [Charles Fairchild card](/guest/prestige/fairchilds) does not reference a reputation level. The card does, however, have 2 fleurs-de-lis in the upper left-hand corner (and also shows the Fairchild family crest in place of a reputation level); therefore, Charles is a prestige guest, and he does enable the Admirer Bonus.
