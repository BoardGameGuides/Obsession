The Barn is the service location that references the employment of a head gardener and empowers the family to enhance their reputation when estate activities are hosted.

Few aesthetic pursuits more iconically represent 19th century English culture than the enjoyment of gardens and manicured grounds. A serious investment in the beloved grounds of the family's estate would draw notice and praise, and enhance the family's reputation in the area.

The Barn service tile appears randomly in the builders' market and has a discount of Â£100 attached to the purchase price. When a player acquires this tile, it is placed under SERVICE in the country estate organiser. On all future turns when an estate tile is played, the player increases his reputation by one on his player board reputation wheel.

Note that the Barn is worth 2 victory points; all other service tiles are worth at most 1 victory point.
